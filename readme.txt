Life Insurance site was built by Jim Deng using Bootstrap theme,HTML5/CSS3 and AngularJS technology.

Assumptions:
1. As it is demonstration site, it does not require all features or links to be fully fuctional.
2. As automatic build and integration test environments are different in different organizations, I have not included any test scripts into this site yet due to my tight schedule this week. And a build and testing process can be created using below technology:
  a. Karma/Selenium test runner to launch tests for UI and JavaScript(AngularJS).
  B. AngularMocks/Jasmine provides support for injecting and mocking Angular services in unit tests.

User Scenarios:
1. Please click the index.html to start the website.
2. The main calculator is included in the Cover Calculator page.
